    "# Assessment of Operating Envelopes to Orchestrate DERs\n",
    "# OE Algorithm 3: Asset Capacity & Critical Voltage\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This work is part of the project [Assessing the Benefits of Using Operating Envelopes to Orchestrate DERs Across Australia](https://electrical.eng.unimelb.edu.au/power-energy/projects/assessing-the-benefits-of-OEs-across-Australia) funded by CSIRO. This project provided key metrics and recommendations for distribution companies (known as Distribution Network Service Providers [DNSPs] in Australia) and AEMO (the Australian system operator) to assist them in their decision-making process when defining the most suitable Operating Envelope (OE) implementations in a given distribution area.\n",
    "\n",
    "> <span style=\"color:purple\">**What are Operating Envelopes (OEs)?** OEs are time-varying export or import limits calculated in real time or in advance at the connection point of the customer to ensure the integrity of the distribution network (i.e., customer voltages within limits and no asset congestion). The OEs are calculated only for customers with flexible connection agreements (called here *active customers*). Customers with conventional connection agreements (called here *passive customers*) do not require OEs.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "**This interactive notebook demonstrates the process to implement the *Asset Capacity & Critical Voltage OE Algorithm*** produced by The University of Melbourne. This demonstration is useful for different stakeholders (e.g., DNSPs, AEMO, CSIRO, regulators, consultancy companies, technology providers) as it can help them familiarise with the corresponding algorithm and the required inputs as well as the pros and cons.\n",
    "\n",
    "> <span style=\"color:purple\">The **Asset Capacity & Critical Voltage (AC_CrV) OE** is more advanced than the Asset Capacity OE as both voltage and thermal aspects are considered instead of only thermal. Thermal aspects are considered by calculating the spare capacity of the distribution transformer, while voltage aspects are considered by estimating the voltage at the critical customer via a P-V sensitivity curve.</span>\n",
    "> - Monitoring: At the secondary of the transformer (aggregated P and aggregated Q per phase), and at the critical customer (voltage magnitude and net demand P).\n",
    "> - Electrical models needed: None.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Algorithm Overview  \n",
    "The **AC_CrV OE** requires a P-V sensitivity curve that is used to estimate the voltage at the critical customer from its net active power demand. This P-V sensitivity curve can be obtained beforehand with historical data from the critical customer, and it can be used for every time step since the sensitivity curve is unlikely to change within short time periods. To obtain this P-V sensitivity curve:\n",
    "- Take the historical net active power demand and voltages of the critical customer for a given period (e.g., two days), and use them as input to a polynomial fit function from a standard library (e.g., Python NumPy).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the required sensitivity curve is available, the AC_CrV OE algorithm has two main steps. First, the spare capacity of the distribution transformer is split among active customers (temporary OE value). Second, the P-V sensitivity curve for the critical customer is used to estimate its voltage according to the temporary OE value. If the voltage is beyond the limit, the temporary OE value is reduced and the voltage re-estimated and re-assessed. This repeats until no voltage problem is expected. Furthermore, for calculations in advance (e.g., hours ahead), forecasting capabilities are also needed (however, here, perfect forecasting is used for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given point in time (e.g., at 12:00PM), the high-level steps of the algorithm are as follows:\n",
    "1. **Obtain forecasted aggregated passive customer net demand**. This value is obtained by subtracting the forecasted aggregated active customer net demand from the forecasted distribution transformer demand (which includes all customers). Note that sign convention and direction of power flows have to be adequately considered since one can be importing and the other exporting power depending on the time of the day. \n",
    "2. **Calculate the spare capacity of the distribution transformer for OE exports (or OE imports)**. This value is obtained by subtracting the aggregated passive customer net demand forecast from the rated capacity of the transformer. It forms the basis to calculate OE exports (or OE imports). Note that sign convention and direction of power flows have to be adequately considered as the spare capacity will be different for exports and imports.\n",
    "3. **Check if spare capacity is available for OE exports (or OE imports)**. If there is spare capacity available, proceed to step 4 to split the spare capacity. Otherwise, the calculated OE value to all active customers is equal to zero, thus proceed to step 7.\n",
    "4. **Allocate the spare capacity for OE exports (or OE imports)**. Divide the spare capacity among all active customers, proportionally, considering the corresponding DER sizes. The allocated spare capacity to each active customer is a temporary OE value (P').\n",
    "5. **Estimate the voltage at the critical customer for OE exports (or OE imports)**. Use the temporary OE value (P') for the critical customer and the P-V sensitivity curve to estimate the voltage magnitude (V') at this customer.\n",
    "6. **Check for voltage problems at the critical customer for OE exports (or OE imports)**. If the estimated voltage at the critical customer breaches the network limit, reduce the temporary OE value (P') of the critical customer by a pre-defined value (e.g., 1kW), and go back to step 5. Otherwise, the temporary OE value P' corresponds to the OE exports (or imports) for each active customer, thus proceed to step 7.\n",
    "7. **Move to the next time step (e.g., 12:05PM) and restart the process from step 1.**\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">**<u>Note 1</u>.</span>** The OE exports and OE imports are calculated separately. When calculating exports, all active customers are considered to export. When calculating imports, all active customers are considered to import. This ensures the asset integrity even if all active customers operate at their maximum allocated OE capacity (worst case scenario).\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">**<u>Note 2</u>.</span>** For simplicity, in step 1, only the active power demand (P) was considered for the forecasted aggregated active customer net demand. However, if the reactive power demand (Q) is available (as it is the case for most monitoring devices), then it should be considered in the calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">**<u>Note 3</u>.</span>** The forecasted aggregated passive customer net demand in step 1 can also be obtained in other ways. For instance, if the DNSP has 100% smart meter penetration and forecast for all customers, the net demand of passive customers can be simply summed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">**<u>Note 4</u>.</span>** Network losses are not being considered here, but it should be simple to add to the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">**<u>Note 5</u>.</span>** For OE calculations in real-time no forecast is needed, real-time measurements from the network/customers should be used instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">**<u>Note 6</u>.</span>** Only the proportional allocation can be done for the AC_CrV OE since other allocation techniques usually require knowledge of voltages in all customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">**<u>Note 7</u>.</span>** The OE values are calculated for the active power only. The reactive power of PV systems are considered to be zero all the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">**<u>Note 8</u>.</span>** The OE was not constrained by the LV head of feeder because it was considered the simplest possible algorithm to avoid needing extra data, but it can be easily added if data from individual LV feeders are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Inputs and Outputs for the OE Calculation Algorithm\n",
    "### Time-Varying Inputs\n",
    "- Historical voltage magnitude of the critical active customer in the LV network.\n",
    "- Historical net active power demand of the critical active customer in the LV network.\n",
    "- Forecasted aggregated active customer net demand (P).\n",
    "- Forecasted distribution transformer demand (P, Q).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Static Inputs\n",
    "- Rated capacity of the distribution transformer.\n",
    "- Number of active customers.\n",
    "- DER size of active customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputs\n",
    "- The OEs for exports and imports. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Test LV Network\n",
    "To demonstrate the OE algorithm, the realistic Test LV network shown in Figure 1 is used. This network has the following characteristics:\n",
    "- Three 3-phase LV feeders.\n",
    "- 114 single-phase residential customers connected via service cables. \n",
    "- 16 (out of 114) are active customers (around 15%).\n",
    "- 98 (out of 114) are passive customers.\n",
    "- 35 of passive customers have PV systems (a PV penetration of 30% for the whole LV network).\n",
    "- The PV systems have the same installed capacity of 5kVA. They also have the combined Volt-Watt and Volt-Var functions enabled.\n",
    "- All active customers have the same DER installed capacity of 10kVA (e.g., PV + battery).\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">**<u>Note</u>.</span>** For simplicity, the case study used to demonstrate the OE algorithm corresponds to a low voltage (LV) network without modelling the upstream high voltage (HV) network. Although some adaptations have been made to ensure realistic voltage fluctuations at the distribution transformer of the LV network, the results are not exactly the same as those presented in the Final Report of the project (which used an integrated HV-LV network model). Nevertheless, the behaviour of the OE algorithm and the qualitative nature of the results remain the same. The following adaptions were made:\n",
    "- The voltage variation along the day caused by the HV part is modelled as a voltage source (following the values taken from the full HV-LV model).\n",
    "- To better represent the voltage rise/drop at the primary side of the distribution transformer (due to OE exports/imports), a fictitious line is created between the voltage source and the distribution transformer.\n",
