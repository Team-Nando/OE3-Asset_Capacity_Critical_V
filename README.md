# Assessment of Operating Envelopes to Orchestrate DERs - OE Algorithm 3: Asset Capacity & Critical Voltage
This repository is part of the project [Assessing the Benefits of Using Operating Envelopes to Orchestrate DERs Across Australia](https://electrical.eng.unimelb.edu.au/power-energy/projects/assessing-the-benefits-of-OEs-across-Australia) funded by CSIRO. This project provided key metrics and recommendations for distribution companies (known as Distribution Network Service Providers [DNSPs] in Australia) and AEMO (the Australian system operator) to assist them in their decision-making process when defining the most suitable Operating Envelope (OE) implementations in a given distribution area.

In this repository, we use interactive code via Jupyter Notebook and Python as well as a realistic residential low voltage (LV) network to demonstrate the process and necessary calculations for the *Asset Capacity & Critical Voltage OE Algorithm* produced by The University of Melbourne. This demonstration is useful for different stakeholders (e.g., DNSPs, AEMO, CSIRO, regulators, consultancy companies, technology providers) as it can help them familiarise with the corresponding algorithm and the required inputs as well as the pros and cons.

## Asset Capacity & Critical Voltage OE
The Asset Capacity & Critical Voltage OE is more advanced than the Asset Capacity OE as both voltage and thermal issues are considered instead of only thermal issues. At a given moment in time, it considers the spare thermal capacity of the distribution transformer (i.e., thermal capacity minus net demand of all the customers) and splits it among active customers. Then, using the spare capacity allocated to the critical customer (i.e., the customer located furthest from the distribution transformer), it estimates the voltage at the critical customer via a sensitivity curve that relates the net demand P to the voltage magnitude of the critical customer.
- Monitoring: At the secondary of the transformer (aggregated P and aggregated Q per phase), and at the critical customer (voltage magnitude and net demand P).
- Electrical models needed: None.

For simplicity, the case study used to demonstrate the OE algorithm corresponds to a low voltage (LV) network without modelling the upstream high voltage (HV) network. Although some adaptations have been made to ensure realistic voltage fluctuations at the distribution transformer of the LV network, the results are not exactly the same as those presented in the Final Report of the project (which used an integrated HV-LV network model). Nevertheless, the behaviour of the OE algorithm and the qualitative nature of the results remain the same.

## Pre-Requisites
- Python (Anaconda) and Jupyter Notebook (comes with Anaconda). For download links and more info: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
- dss_python module. We use this Python-native module to run power flows based on OpenDSS (https://sourceforge.net/projects/electricdss/). To install, run "python -m pip install dss_python" in the Anaconda Prompt. For more info: https://github.com/Team-Nando/Tutorial-DERHostingCapacity-0-dss_python#part-0-using-dss_python

## Run the Code
Make sure you have installed all the pre-requisites (Anaconda and the dss_python module). Otherwise, you will not be able to go through the repository.

1. Download all the files using the green **`<> Code`** button at the top right.
   - You will get a ZIP file with a folder that contains all the files.
   - Unzip the file an place the folder somewhere in your computer/laptop.
3. To open the Jupyter notebook file (extension **`ipynb`**) you need to:
   - Open Anaconda Navigator
   - Click on Launch Jupyter notebook (it will open in your browser)
   - Upload the unzipped folder (with all the corresponding files) to Jupyter Notebook (the location is up to you)
   - Go inside the folder and open the **`ipynb`** file

All the instructions will be in the **`ipynb`** file.
